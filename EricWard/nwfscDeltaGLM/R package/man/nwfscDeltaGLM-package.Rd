Package for conducting Bayesian estimation of CPUE index standardization (fisheries, ecology, etc).
~~ package title ~~
}
\description{
The nwfscDeltaGLM package is developed by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, National Oceanic Administration, USA. It's primary purpose is for application to stock assessment, where it can be used to generate time series of CPUE indices from raw trawl data. Optional model components include vessel, strata, and year effects, as well as their interactions. A number of likelihoods are included for the positive component of the model, including both continuous (lognormal, gamma, inverse Gaussian) and discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) distributions.
