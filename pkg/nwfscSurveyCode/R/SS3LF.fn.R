    #     You will want this to be T when inputting into SS3, but may want it to be false when plotting

    #           number of males and females observed in the same size class (or one lower if none available in the same bin)
    #       -- if a vector (maybe to be implemented), it must be the same length as the lgthBins and indicates the proportion of unsexed assigned to females for each length bin
    #       -- if it is NA, unsexed fish are omitted WHEN GENDER=3 (THIS IS THE DEFAULT)
    #     maxSizeUnsexed determines the maximum size at which the sexRatioUnsexed is applied. If sexRatioUnsexed is a vector, this is ignored
